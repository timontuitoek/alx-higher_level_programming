Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.

A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class.

OOP deals with four major principles:

Encapsulation
Data Abstraction
Polymorphism
Inheritance

Encapsulation: 
it refers to the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. The main idea behind encapsulation is to restrict direct access to the internal state of an object and provide controlled access through methods, which are often referred to as getters and setters.

Data sobstraction:
Is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that involves representing the essential properties and behaviors of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It provides a way to model real-world entities in a program in a simplified manner, focusing only on the relevant attributes and operations.

Polymorphism:
Is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a consistent way, abstracting away the specific implementation details of each class.

Inheritance:
Is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class to inherit properties (attributes and methods) from an existing class. The existing class is referred to as the "base class," "superclass," or "parent class," and the new class is called the "derived class," "subclass," or "child class." Inheritance facilitates code reuse and the creation of a hierarchical relationship between classes.
