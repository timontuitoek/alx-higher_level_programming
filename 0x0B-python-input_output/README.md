Input/Output (I/O) refers to the process of getting data into a program (input) and sending data out of a program (output). It's a fundamental aspect of programming that allows applications to interact with users, read from and write to files, and communicate with other programs or systems.

Python I/O operations are essential for building interactive programs, processing data from various sources, and creating data-driven applications. They provide the means to interact with users, read and write data files, and exchange information with external systems, making Python a versatile language for a wide range of applications.
