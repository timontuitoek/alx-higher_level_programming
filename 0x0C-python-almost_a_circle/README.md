Python Programming Concepts and Techniques
This README provides an overview of important Python programming concepts and techniques that every developer should be familiar with.

Import
In Python, the import statement is used to include external modules or libraries in your code. It allows you to access functions, classes, and variables defined in these modules, extending the functionality of your program. For example:

python
Copy code
import math
result = math.sqrt(25)
print(result)  # Output: 5.0
Exceptions
Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. In Python, you can handle exceptions using try and except blocks to gracefully manage errors. For example:

python
Copy code
try:
    num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / num
    print(result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input!")
Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have. Here's a simple class definition:

python
Copy code
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
Private Attribute
In Python, attributes and methods can be marked as private by prefixing them with an underscore. Private attributes are intended to be used within the class only. Example:

python
Copy code
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._private_var = 42
Getter/Setter
Getter and setter methods are used to access and modify private attributes of a class. They provide controlled access to these attributes. Example:

python
Copy code
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self):
        self._private_var = 0

    def get_private_var(self):
        return self._private_var

    def set_private_var(self, value):
        if value >= 0:
            self._private_var = value
Class Method
A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It is defined using the @classmethod decorator and takes the class as its first argument. Example:

python
Copy code
class MyClass:
    count = 0

    @classmethod
    def increment_count(cls):
        cls.count += 1
Static Method
A static method is a method that belongs to the class and does not depend on instance-specific data. It is defined using the @staticmethod decorator. Example:

python
Copy code
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add(a, b):
        return a + b
Inheritance
Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. It promotes code reusability and supports the creation of more specialized classes. Example:

python
Copy code
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand):
        self.brand = brand

class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, model):
        super().__init__(brand)
        self.model = model
Unittest
Unittest is a Python testing framework used for writing and running test cases. It helps ensure that your code functions correctly. Example:

python
Copy code
import unittest

class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
Read/Write File
Python provides built-in functions for reading and writing files. You can open files, read their contents, and write data to them using the open() function. Example:

python
Copy code
# Reading a file
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()

# Writing to a file
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!")
