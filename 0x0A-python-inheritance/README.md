 Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create new classes based on existing classes. It enables you to define a new class (called a subclass or derived class) by inheriting the attributes and methods of an existing class (called a superclass or base class). Here's a short description of inheritance in Python:

Inheritance in Python is a powerful mechanism that allows you to create new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from existing classes. A new class, known as the subclass, can reuse and extend the attributes and methods of a parent class, known as the superclass. This promotes code reuse and modularity in your programs, as you can build upon existing classes to create specialized or customized classes. Inheritance forms the foundation of object-oriented programming, facilitating the creation of hierarchical class structures and promoting the principles of abstraction and encapsulation. With inheritance, you can efficiently model relationships between objects and achieve a high degree of code organization and maintainability in your Python programs.

In summary, inheritance in Python is a crucial concept that allows you to create new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reusability and making it easier to manage and extend your code
